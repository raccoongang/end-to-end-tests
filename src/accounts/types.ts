 * ([issue #10](https://github.com/openedx/end-to-end-tests/issues/10),
 * [issue #15](https://github.com/openedx/end-to-end-tests/issues/15)).
 *
 * A backend decides what varies by installation:
 * 1. which identity to register with (`createIdentity`) — a throwaway address for
 *    auto-activating targets, or an operator-supplied inbox for manual runs;
 * 2. how the account is created (`register`) — the LMS registration API by
 *    default, or the install's own service when the LMS is not the source of
 *    identity;
 * 3. how a freshly-registered account becomes able to sign in (`activate`) — a
 *    no-op when the target auto-activates, or fetching the activation link
 *    otherwise; and
 * 4. how an existing account signs in and out (`signIn`, `signInThroughUi`,
 *    `signOutThroughUi`) — the LMS login-session API and the authn MFE by
 *    default, or an SSO/IdP flow for installs that replace them.
 *
 * Only `createIdentity` and `activate` are required. `register` and the three
 * auth flows are optional: when a backend omits one, the built-in default runs
 * (`registerLearnerAccount` for `register`, `default-flows.ts` for the rest), so a
 * backend that only customizes account creation stays a two-method
 * implementation.
 *
 * Selecting a backend by config (`ACCOUNT_BACKEND`) keeps the specs identical
 * across targets.
