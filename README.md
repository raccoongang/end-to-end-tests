# end-to-end-tests

End-to-end tests for the Open edX Platform, written in [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
and TypeScript.

The suite is **deployment-agnostic**: most providers should be able to point it at
their own Open edX installation through configuration alone, without editing test
code.

See [ADR-0002](docs/decisions/0002-core-principles.rst) for the core principles
guiding development, and [`docs/findings.md`](docs/findings.md) for the defects
this suite has surfaced upstream — the reason behind every `test.fixme()` and
workaround in the tree.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** (see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc)). With [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):
  ```sh
  nvm install
  nvm use
  ```
- **npm 11+** (ships with Node 24).
- A reachable Open edX installation to test against (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
- **The Open edX Demo Course imported on the target** for the course-completion
  specs.** Those specs need real content to work through, and importing content
  differs per installation. So the course is a prerequisite of the environment
  rather than something the suite creates. Import one with whatever mechanism
  your installation uses — on Tutor:

  ```sh
  tutor local do importdemocourse
  ```

  then point [`COURSE_KEY`](#configuration) at the imported key (the demo course's
  key differs between installs, e.g. `course-v1:OpenedX+DemoX+DemoCourse`). Leave
  `COURSE_KEY` unset and the course-completion specs skip cleanly; set it to a
  course that doesn't exist on the server and pre-test checks will fail at startup.

## Setup

```sh
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Install Playwright browser binaries (first run only)
npm run install:browsers

# 3. Create your local configuration
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env to point at your installation
```

## Configuration

All installation-specific values are read from environment variables and validated
at load time — a missing or malformed value fails fast with a clear message
instead of a confusing test failure. Every variable is documented in
[`.env.example`](.env.example).

Configuration is only required by what actually drives an installation. Test
collection, `--list` and the node-only `unit` project report an invalid
environment as a warning and carry on, so a fresh clone with no `.env` can still
run the unit tests and the quality gates; browser projects fail on it fatally.

The essentials:

| Variable                            | Required | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LMS_BASE_URL`                      | ✅       | LMS origin, e.g. `http://local.openedx.io`                          |
| `APPS_BASE_URL`                     | ✅       | MFE host origin, e.g. `http://apps.local.openedx.io`                |
| `CMS_BASE_URL`                      | —        | Studio origin; required when `studio` is in `CAPABILITIES`          |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | —        | Admin/staff account (set both or neither); also grants `author`     |
| `ORG`                               | —        | Organization short code, e.g. `OpenedX`                             |
| `COURSE_KEY`                        | —        | Course the course-completion specs work through; unset ⇒ they skip  |
| `CAPABILITIES`                      | —        | Comma-separated capabilities enabled on your install                |
| `ALLOW_CROSS_SITE_ORIGINS`          | —        | Escape hatch for non-same-site deployments                          |
| `ACCOUNT_BACKEND`                   | —        | How new accounts clear email activation (see below)                 |
| `CUSTOM_ACCOUNT_BACKEND_PLUGINS`    | —        | Comma-separated paths of custom account backends                    |
| `MAIL_PROVIDER`                     | —        | Mailbox the suite reads e-mail from; required with `email-inbox`    |
| `CUSTOM_MAIL_PROVIDER_PLUGINS`      | —        | Comma-separated paths of mailbox provider plugins (`src/mail/`)     |
| `RUN_ID_SUFFIX`                     | —        | Up to 3 lowercase letters/digits appended to the run id (CI shards) |
| `CI_PROFILE`                        | —        | The CI profile a job runs (`.ci/profiles.json`); set by CI          |

**Where values come from.** Configuration is read from `process.env`, with values
from a local `.env` file layered in underneath. **Real environment variables take
precedence** - a variable already set in your shell or CI environment is _not_
overridden by `.env`. In practice: use `.env` for local development, and set
environment variables directly in CI (no `.env` needed there). A `.env` value only
applies when that variable is not already present in the environment.

**Capabilities.** Coverage that depends on what an installation runs is gated on
an explicit declaration: a spec tagged `@teams` runs only where `CAPABILITIES`
names `teams`.

- **Default-on:** stock surfaces and stock settings are on unless turned off
  with a `-` prefix (`CAPABILITIES=-mfe-authn`), so a missing declaration never
  silently drops coverage an install has.
- **Required partners:** `analytics-in-context`, `analytics-pii` and
  `analytics-staff-video-counts` describe parts of an Aspects deployment and
  need `analytics` declared too;
  `analytics-in-context-cards` needs `analytics-in-context`.
- **Mutually exclusive pairs:** two implementations or configurations of one
  surface. Declaring both halves fails validation.
- **Declared but missing:** a declared capability the target lacks fails its
  specs rather than skipping.

[`docs/capabilities.md`](docs/capabilities.md) describes every capability: what
it means, which specs it gates, which Open edX releases are known to support it,
and where CI turns it on.
Sign-in and sign-out coverage is not gated — it runs through the account
backend's own UI flows, whatever those are.

**Origin requirements.** All origins (LMS, Studio, MFEs) must share **one scheme**
(all `http://` or all `https://`) and **one registrable parent domain** (e.g.
`*.local.openedx.io`), so a single sign-in covers every sub-domain. Do not use
`localhost` or IP addresses - they have no sub-domain structure for shared cookies.
Over HTTP, the target must serve `SameSite=Lax`, non-`Secure` cookies.

## Account creation & email activation

Installations differ in how a newly-registered account becomes able to sign in —
chiefly around email activation. Rather than assume one path, the suite obtains
accounts through a **user-choosable backend** selected by `ACCOUNT_BACKEND`, so the
same specs run against very different targets (see
[issue #10](https://github.com/openedx/end-to-end-tests/issues/10) and
[`src/accounts/README.md`](src/accounts/README.md)).

| `ACCOUNT_BACKEND` | Use when…                                                  | Behaviour                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `automatic`       | "Automatic login on" — the default (incl. Tutor/sandbox)   | Generates a throwaway `@example.com` identity; no email needed. The reusable session is taken from the one registration itself creates.    |
| `manual`          | Target enforces email activation and can't be reconfigured | Interactive: prompts you for an email to register with, then for the activation link/token.                                                |
| `openinbox`       | You want activation email automated, unattended            | Example plugin (`plugins/openinbox.plugin.ts`): registers with a disposable openinbox.io inbox and visits the activation link it receives. |
| _plugin name_     | Your install has its own auth/mailbox flow                 | Loaded from `CUSTOM_ACCOUNT_BACKEND_PLUGINS`; see [`src/accounts/README.md`](src/accounts/README.md).                                      |

The `automatic` backend works against the **default** without any email setup:
registration auto-authenticates the account, so the captured (reusable) session and
the registration spec pass even on installs that leave accounts inactive until
activation. Specs that drive a **separate** UI sign-in (`login`, `logout`) still
need an install where the account can actually log in — i.e.
`SKIP_EMAIL_VALIDATION = True`, or the `manual` backend to activate the account
first.

A 3rd-party mailbox API is covered by the `openinbox` example plugin rather than
a built-in backend; a plugin for any other mailbox service follows the same
contract. Plugins are currently local-only: the CI workflows expose no input for
`CUSTOM_ACCOUNT_BACKEND_PLUGINS`.

### Registration rate limit

Open edX caps account registrations per IP with `REGISTRATION_RATELIMIT`, whose
default is **`60/7d`** (60 per 7 days). Because each run creates several accounts,
frequent runs exhaust it and registration then fails with `HTTP 403`
`forbidden-request` — the suite reports this explicitly. For any target you run
against repeatedly, raise the limit to a short, self-resetting window (the
platform's own test settings use per-minute values). With Tutor, override the LMS
setting and restart:

```py
# a Tutor plugin patch on "openedx-common-settings"
REGISTRATION_RATELIMIT = "100/m"
```

```sh
tutor local restart lms   # or: tutor dev restart lms
```

If you have already tripped the default limit, either apply the override above and
restart, or wait for the 7-day window to reset.

### Password reset rate limit

The password-reset request is throttled twice over, per IP **and** per email
address:

| Setting                     | Default | Scope                           |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `PASSWORD_RESET_IP_RATE`    | `1/m`   | one request per minute per IP   |
| `PASSWORD_RESET_EMAIL_RATE` | `2/h`   | two requests per hour per email |

The per-IP limit is the one that bites: **one request per minute** covers every
worker on the machine, so a second reset request within the same minute — a
re-run, a Playwright retry, or another spec — is rejected. `POST /account/password`
then answers `HTTP 403` with:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "value": "Your previous request is in progress, please try again in a few moments."
}
```

Note that message is misleading: nothing is in progress, the request was
throttled. The authn MFE renders it as a generic error alert, so the symptom is a
password-reset spec that passes alone and fails when re-run within the minute.

Only the reset-request test posts (an invalid address is rejected in the browser
without a request), so a single run is fine; back-to-back runs and CI retries are
not. Raise the limit on any target you run against repeatedly:

```py
# a Tutor plugin patch on "openedx-common-settings"
PASSWORD_RESET_IP_RATE = "100/m"
PASSWORD_RESET_EMAIL_RATE = "100/m"
```

```sh
tutor local restart lms   # or: tutor dev restart lms
```

### Running with the `manual` backend

Set `ACCOUNT_BACKEND=manual` and run with a **single worker** so the interactive
prompts don't interleave:

```sh
ACCOUNT_BACKEND=manual npx playwright test --project=smoke --workers=1 \
  -g "signs in with valid credentials"
```

For each account the suite provisions, it prompts on your terminal to:

1. **enter an email** to register with — use an inbox you can read;
   plus-addressing (`you+e2e1@example.com`) lets one inbox serve several runs; and
2. **paste the activation link or token** from the resulting email (either the
   full `.../activate/<key>` URL or just the key).

The prompt reads your controlling terminal directly (via `/dev/tty`) and disables
the test timeout while it waits, so an interactive run won't time out. Each
provisioned account needs a unique email, so specs that provision their own
account (login, logout, and the `setup` sign-in) prompt once each.

**Getting the activation key without email (Tutor).** If you administer the target
and would rather not wait on (or configure) email, read the pending
registrations' activation keys straight from the database and paste the one
matching the email you registered with:

```sh
tutor local run lms ./manage.py lms shell -c "from common.djangoapps.student.models import Registration; rs = [ (r.user.email, r.activation_key) for r in Registration.objects.select_related('user').all()]; print(rs);"
```

Use `tutor dev run` on a dev stack. The prompt accepts either the bare key or the
full `.../activate/<key>` link.

## Running tests

```sh
npm test                 # run everything
npm run test:smoke       # critical-path (@smoke) tier only
npm run test:regression  # broader (@regression) tier
npm run test:ui          # interactive Playwright UI mode
npm run test:headed      # headed browser
npm run test:debug       # step-through debugger
npm run report           # open the last HTML report
```

Tests are organized into Playwright **projects**:

- `unit` — pure logic tests (e.g. config validation); no browser or target needed.
- `setup` — signs in once per role and writes reusable auth state to `.auth/`.
- `smoke` / `regression` — anonymous browser tests tagged `@smoke` / `@regression`.
- `lms-learner` — authenticated tests (`@authenticated`); depends on `setup`. The
  project loads the captured learner session; specs that change course state use
  the `courseLearner` fixture instead, which provisions a fresh learner per test
  (one registration each — see the rate limit below).
- `studio-author` — Studio tests (`@author`, the `tests/studio/` tree); depends on
  `setup`. Each worker provisions an **author of its own** (see "Studio coverage")
  whose session is valid on Studio as well as the LMS. Runs only when the `studio`
  capability is declared.

Responsive coverage runs at the sizes in [`src/config/viewports.ts`](src/config/viewports.ts)
(phone 375, tablet 768, small desktop 1024, desktop 1280, each on one side of a
breakpoint the Open edX frontends switch on) inside the same projects; there is
no separate mobile project.

On a Tutor `main` target, two toggles that plugins set only in `FEATURES` must
also be set as flat settings for their coverage to run (the `TUTOR-001`
flattening): `ENABLE_COURSE_DISCOVERY` for `catalog-search`, and
`ENABLE_EDXNOTES` for `notes`. The CI workflow's settings patch sets both.

Run a single project or filter by tag:

```sh
npx playwright test --project=unit        # just the unit tests
npx playwright test --project=smoke
npx playwright test --grep @smoke
```

The `unit` project needs no configuration or browsers, so you can run it right
after `npm install`:

```sh
npx playwright test --project=unit
```

## Studio coverage

Studio specs run when `CAPABILITIES` includes `studio` and `CMS_BASE_URL` is set
(declaring one without the other fails configuration). Leave `studio` undeclared
on an LMS-only target and the whole `tests/studio/` tree skips.

**The `author` role.** The `setup` project provisions a fresh account, gives it a
Studio session (Studio keeps its own session behind a silent OAuth handshake with
the LMS — no second sign-in, no credentials; an install that fronts Studio with
its own IdP replaces this through the account backend's `signInStudio`), and
grants it course-creator status. The `studio-author` project then provisions
**one such author per worker** (`workerAuthor`) and runs that worker's tests as
it: the platform's `PREVENT_CONCURRENT_LOGINS` (on by default) ends a user's
other sessions on every sign-in, and the browser specs sign the author in through
the UI per test, so a single shared author would have each worker logging the
others out mid-test. The admin is the one account that stays shared, so anything
that signs in as the admin (the course-creator grant, the superuser-in-a-browser
fixtures) runs under a cross-worker lock and reuses the `setup` session where it
can — which also keeps admin sign-ins clear of the platform's **per-account
login rate limit** (`LOGISTRATION_PER_EMAIL_RATELIMIT_RATE`, default `30/5m`;
exceeded, sign-in answers `400` "Too many failed login attempts"). Repeated local
runs within five minutes can still reach it; wait it out or raise the setting.
On a default install (`ENABLE_CREATOR_GROUP` on) the only grant path is the Studio
Django admin, so the default account backend signs in as `ADMIN_USERNAME` /
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` (a superuser) to approve the request. Without an admin account
the `author` role — and every Studio spec — skips, unless the install grants every
user (then no admin is needed). Installs that gate course creation differently
implement `grantCourseCreator` in an account backend plugin
([`src/accounts/README.md`](src/accounts/README.md)).

**Courses the suite creates.** There is no API to delete a course, so the suite
keeps the count low: the settings specs share **one course per worker**
(`authoredCourse`), the authoring-to-learner round-trip specs share **two more
per worker** (`contentCourse` and `futureCourse`, with `authoringCourse` giving a
per-test course only where a spec needs isolation), the instructor-dashboard
certificate specs share **one more** (`certificateCourse`, set up so certificates
can be issued), and each builds a uniquely named **section** inside its course
rather than a new course. Only the specs whose
subject is course creation make their own. **Content libraries accumulate the
same way:** `DELETE /api/libraries/v2/<lib>/` answers 500 for any library that
ever held a unit, subsection or section ([`LIB-001`](docs/findings.md), filed as
[edx-platform#39117](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-platform/issues/39117)),
so the library specs seed
one small library per test (`seededLibrary`, plus an empty `authoringLibrary`
where a spec mutates), attempt the delete, and rely on run-unique slugs
(`e2e-<run id>-…`) to keep runs apart; every list they select a library from is
filtered by that slug or title first. Every suite course is numbered `E2E<run id><slot>` under `ORG` (or
`E2E` when `ORG` is unset). On a persistent target, purge them with the CMS
management command — it prompts, so pipe `yes` into it:

```sh
yes | tutor local exec cms ./manage.py cms delete_course <course key>
```

then `./manage.py cms reindex_course --all --setup` if deleted courses still show
in catalog search.

**There is no equivalent for v2 libraries today.** The CMS offers
`export_content_library`, `import_content_library` and
`migrate_course_legacy_library_blocks_to_item_bank`, but nothing that deletes a
v2 library, and `LIB-001` blocks the per-library API for any library that held a
container — so the libraries the suite seeds stay on a persistent target. The
legacy half is different: `./manage.py cms delete_v1_libraries` (run it with
`--help` for its arguments) covers the `library-v1:` libraries the
`legacyLibrary` fixture creates.

CI's Tutor installs are ephemeral, so nothing accumulates there.

## Quality gates

```sh
npm run check         # typecheck + lint + format:check (run before pushing)

npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit (strict; catches what Playwright's transpile won't)
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run lint:fix      # ESLint with autofix
npm run format        # Prettier write
npm run format:check  # Prettier check
```

## CI workflows

Browser specs need a running Open edX installation, so they run in dedicated
GitHub Actions workflows rather than the fast PR gate (`ci.yml`, which runs
static checks and the browser-free `unit` project as required, blocking checks).
Both workflows share the same [`run-suite`](.github/actions/run-suite/action.yml)
composite action, which runs the suite (or one shard of it) and uploads a
Playwright blob report, and the [`report-suite`](.github/actions/report-suite/action.yml)
action, which merges blob reports (`merge.config.ts`) into the HTML report and
suite reports, writes the job summary and publishes BTR results. They differ
only in how the target installation is provisioned.

`ci.yml` additionally runs `run_tests_tutor.yml` twice every PR and push to
`main`: once against an ephemeral **`Tutor main`**, and once against the **last
named release** environment (currently `verawood`). Each runs the full suite
under the `default` and `extended` CI profiles (see _CI profiles and shards_
below), so a PR's result covers everything the scheduled runs do.

### `run_tests_tutor.yml` — ephemeral Tutor installation

Stands up a fresh **Tutor "local"** Open edX install on the runner (installing
the named release's Tutor/plugin versions, launching it, importing the demo
course, and creating an admin user), then runs the suite against it. Everything
is provisioned from scratch, so this is a heavier, self-contained job — nothing
to configure beforehand beyond triggering it.

Triggers:

- **`workflow_dispatch`** — run on demand with:

  | Input              | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
  | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `openedx_release`  | Named release (`main`, `verawood`, `ulmo`, `teak`, `sumac`, `redwood`); drives the Tutor/plugin version and capabilities. Default `verawood`.                        |
  | `test_ref`         | Git ref of _this_ repo to test. Defaults to the branch the workflow runs from.                                                                                       |
  | `domains`          | Space-separated domains to run (e.g. `lms studio`). Empty = all.                                                                                                     |
  | `features`         | Space-separated tag filter (e.g. `@smoke @discussions`). Empty = all.                                                                                                |
  | `exclude_features` | Space-separated tags to exclude (mapped to `--grep-invert`, e.g. `@unit`). Empty = exclude nothing.                                                                  |
  | `capabilities`     | Override the release's default capabilities (comma-separated); each profile's delta still applies. Empty = use the release default from `.ci/openedx-releases.json`. |
  | `profiles`         | Space-separated CI profiles to run (keys of `.ci/profiles.json`, see below), e.g. `default extended`. Default `default`.                                             |
  | `btr_sheet_url`    | Override: publish BTR results to this Google Sheet instead of the release's `BTR_SHEET_URL_<RELEASE>` variable (see [BTR results sheets](#btr-results-sheets)).      |

- **`schedule`** — automatically at **09:00 UTC (5am US Eastern in daylight
  time), Mondays and Fridays**,
  always against this repo's `main` branch with the `main` Open edX release
  (`domains`/`features`/`capabilities` are dispatch-only and don't apply to
  scheduled runs, so scheduled runs cover the full suite with `main`'s default
  capabilities).

- **`workflow_call`** — called by `ci.yml`'s `docker-main` and
  `docker-last-release` jobs (see above); same inputs as `workflow_dispatch`.

The Tutor install also runs a [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org) catcher
(a `local-docker-compose-services` patch, with `SMTP_HOST=mailpit` and
`RUN_SMTP=false`), so the platform's mail lands where the `mailpit` provider
reads it and `email-inbox` is declared for `main` and `verawood`. Tutor's own
relay delivers straight to recipients' mail servers on port 25, which
GitHub-hosted runners block. To run the e-mail specs against a local Tutor,
do the same there (the `tutor-contrib-mailpit` plugin targets `tutor dev`
only, so copy its service into a `local-docker-compose-services` patch) and
set `MAIL_PROVIDER=mailpit`, `CUSTOM_MAIL_PROVIDER_PLUGINS=./plugins/mailpit.plugin.ts`
and `MAILPIT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8025`.

**CI profiles and shards.** [`.ci/profiles.json`](.ci/profiles.json) defines
the named configurations a release can run under. Each profile lists the Tutor
plugin files that configure the install (`.ci/tutor/e2e_base.py` holds the
settings every profile starts from), a capability delta applied to the
release's list, and a shard count. A `plan` job expands the selected profiles
into one `run` job per shard. Each provisions its **own** Tutor install, so
shards never share users, courses or site settings, and runs its slice of the
suite with `--shard`. A `merge` job then combines every shard's blob report into
the release's single `playwright-report-<release>` and `suite-reports-<release>`
artifacts. `scripts/ci-profiles.mts` reads the file, and the `unit` project
validates it. Each shard's run id carries a `RUN_ID_SUFFIX` (profile code +
shard number), so data created by different shards never collides.

Three profiles exist, and `ci.yml` runs all three for `main` and `verawood`:

| Profile    | Runs                                                                   | Installation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `default`  | the whole suite, in 4 shards                                           | `.ci/tutor/e2e_base.py`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `extended` | only the cases `default` skips (`select: "delta"`)                     | plus `.ci/tutor/e2e_extended.py` (AuthZ migration left to an operator, a `SUPPORT_URL`), `.ci/seed/extended.sh` (a second-organization course, an intro video on the demo course) and, where the release has the plugin, `tutor-contrib-codejail` for Python-graded problems               |
| `aspects`  | only the analytics cases (`select: "delta"`), on `main` and `verawood` | plus `tutor-contrib-aspects` (a line per release in the profile: 6.x on `main`, frontend-base 2; 5.1+ on `verawood`, frontend-base 1) and `.ci/tutor/e2e_aspects.py` (learner PII and in-context metrics on, Superset reachable from the LMS container), on its own prebuilt image variant |

A `select: "delta"` profile runs only the tests tagged with a capability it
declares and `default` does not. The merge then reports those tests from it and
everything else from `default`. `rbac-global` is not in `extended`: turning the
authz flag on for the whole site locks every unmigrated course's team out of
Studio, which the other cases need. It would need a profile of its own.

A profile can declare an **image variant** (`images`): `build_tutor_main_images.yml`
builds it nightly for each release the profile runs on, with the profile's Tutor
plugins and extensions enabled, and pushes it under its own tags and BuildKit
caches (`<image>:<release>-<variant>`). The `aspects` variant is the Open edX,
MFE, Aspects and Superset images. A variant job pulls it; if the pull fails it
stops (a variant cannot be rebuilt on the runner, where the profile's plugins
are enabled only after launch), so run the build workflow and retry.

The MySQL state after migrations is cached per release/Tutor-version so most
runs skip the ~20-minute migration step; delete the `tutor-mysql-*` cache from
the Actions UI if it ever needs a clean rebuild.

**Per-release configuration.** [`.ci/openedx-releases.json`](.ci/openedx-releases.json)
is the single source of truth for what each named release needs: the Tutor
version constraint (replacing what used to be a hardcoded shell `case`
statement) and the default `CAPABILITIES` to declare for that release, since
feature/MFE availability can differ across platform versions. Adding or
removing a supported release is just an edit to that file (plus the matching
`openedx_release` dropdown option in the workflow — `ci.yml`'s "Verify
openedx_release choices match .ci/openedx-releases.json" step fails the build
if the two ever drift apart).

### `run_tests_external.yml` — arbitrary, already-running installation

Runs the suite against **any installation you already have running** — a Tutor
`dev` stack, a staging server, or a provider's own environment — instead of
provisioning one. This is how providers point the suite at their own
installation without editing any code.

Credentials are sourced from a **GitHub Environment** (Settings → Environments)
rather than hard-coded, so different targets (and their approval/protection
rules) stay isolated from each other:

| Input                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `environment` (required)   | Name of the GitHub Environment to source `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` secrets from.                                                                                           |
| `test_ref`                 | Git ref of this repo to test. Defaults to the branch the workflow runs from.                                                                                                       |
| `lms_base_url` (required)  | LMS origin, e.g. `https://courses.example.com`.                                                                                                                                    |
| `apps_base_url` (required) | MFE host origin, e.g. `https://apps.example.com`.                                                                                                                                  |
| `cms_base_url`             | Studio origin. Leave empty to skip Studio specs.                                                                                                                                   |
| `org`                      | Organization short code.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `course_key`               | Default course for course-completion specs.                                                                                                                                        |
| `capabilities`             | Comma-separated capabilities enabled on the target.                                                                                                                                |
| `account_backend`          | `automatic` (default; works on the default install, see above) or `manual` (interactive — not usable in CI).                                                                       |
| `allow_cross_site_origins` | Set when LMS/Studio/MFE origins are not same-site.                                                                                                                                 |
| `mail_provider`            | `none` (default) or `openinbox`: where the target's notification e-mail is read. `openinbox` needs an `OPENINBOX_API_KEY` Environment secret; add `email-inbox` to `capabilities`. |
| `domains` / `features`     | Same filters as above.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `exclude_features`         | Space-separated tags to exclude (mapped to `--grep-invert`, e.g. `@unit`). Empty = exclude nothing.                                                                                |
| `openedx_release`          | Release the target runs (a key of `.ci/openedx-releases.json`). Enables publishing to that release's BTR results sheet. Empty = no publish.                                        |
| `btr_sheet_url`            | Override sheet URL for this run; requires `openedx_release`.                                                                                                                       |

To run it against your own installation: create a GitHub Environment (e.g.
`staging`) with `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` secrets (and any required
approval rule), then trigger the workflow with that environment name and your
target's base URLs.

### BTR results sheets

Every run writes `test-results/btr-run.json`: one row per BTR Release Test Plan
case exercised (spec, result, notes, timing) plus the run's metadata. Scheduled
and manually dispatched runs can **publish** that file to a Google Sheet, one
spreadsheet per Open edX release, kept separate from the manually maintained
BTR sheet. Each publish overwrites the sheet's `Latest` tab (for an unfiltered
run of the default branch), appends a row to the `Runs` index, and adds a
timestamped tab that is kept for comparison over time. PR and push runs never
publish.

To enable it for a release, in the repository (or a fork, or a provider's
deployment):

1. Create a Google Cloud **service account**, download a JSON key, and store the
   key's text as the `BTR_SHEET_CREDENTIALS` secret (repository-wide, or on the
   GitHub Environment an external target uses).
2. Create an **empty Google Sheet** per release and share each one with the
   service account's `client_email` as an **Editor**.
3. Set a repository variable **`BTR_SHEET_URL_<RELEASE>`** per sheet, with the
   release upper-cased: `BTR_SHEET_URL_MAIN`, `BTR_SHEET_URL_VERAWOOD`, … An
   Environment-scoped variable of the same name overrides the repository one
   for `run_tests_external.yml` runs.

The credentials always come from that secret — no workflow or action input
passes them in. A repository without it (a fork, say) still runs the suite: the
publish step warns and skips, leaving the run's result unchanged.

The first publish bootstraps the sheet (tabs, headers, title). A sheet
remembers its release and refuses runs for another one, so a mis-set variable
cannot mix releases. `ci.yml` warns (without failing) about releases that have
no variable. Details and the local re-publish command:
[`src/reporting/README.md`](src/reporting/README.md#publishing-to-the-btr-results-sheets).

### Consuming the suite from another CI system

The two workflows above are how _this_ repository runs the suite. A deployment
pipeline that owns an Open edX installation should not reimplement them - it
should reuse the same runnable unit and supply only the target.

- **GitHub Actions**: use the
  [`run-suite`](.github/actions/run-suite/action.yml) composite action.
- **GitLab CI**: include [`ci/gitlab/run-suite.yml`](ci/gitlab/run-suite.yml)
  and extend the hidden `.openedx-e2e` job it defines. That file's header
  comment is the reference for the variables it accepts, and
  [`ci/gitlab/README.md`](ci/gitlab/README.md) has worked examples - gating on a
  deploy, waiting for the target to serve, serialising runs - plus what to check
  on the installation under test.

Both own the same thing - the image, the install, the Playwright command line,
and the report artifacts - so the consuming pipeline is left with the target's
origins, its readiness check, and its credentials. Their inputs correspond:
`features` / `exclude_features` on the action are `E2E_FEATURES` /
`E2E_EXCLUDE_FEATURES` in the template, and adding one to either generally means
adding it to both.

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openedx/end-to-end-tests/<ref>/ci/gitlab/run-suite.yml'

e2e:
  extends: .openedx-e2e
  stage: test
  variables:
    E2E_SUITE_REF: <commit-sha> # required; keep equal to the include ref
    LMS_BASE_URL: https://courses.example.com
    APPS_BASE_URL: https://apps.example.com
```

The suite itself is configured by its ordinary environment variables, set as
`variables:` on that job - so `.env.example` stays the single reference for what
those are, and a new one works in GitLab the day it works locally. Put secrets
in masked CI variables rather than `variables:` values, which are committed in
plain text.

Set `PLAYWRIGHT_JUNIT_OUTPUT_FILE` in any CI system to have the suite _append_ a
JUnit reporter to the ones `playwright.config.ts` declares. Do not pass
`--reporter=junit`: that replaces the whole list and silently disables the
BTR-coverage and accessibility reporters.

The layers have a strict dependency direction —
`config → api → pages → accounts → {auth, steps} → fixtures → tests` — with each
layer's responsibility described in its own `README.md` under `src/`. See
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) (layer diagram and responsibilities) and
[`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) (locator priority, tagging, test-data rules)
for the full mechanics.

## Contributing

Start with [`DEVELOPER.md`](DEVELOPER.md), the condensed guide to writing a
well-formed spec, with links into the detailed documents.

- Write TypeScript under strict settings; `npm run check` must pass.
- Keep configuration centralized in `src/config/` — never read `process.env`
  directly in specs.
- Never commit a real `.env` or captured auth state (both are gitignored).
- When a change works around an upstream defect, or skips a case because of one,
  record it in [`docs/findings.md`](docs/findings.md) and quote its ID in the
  `test.fixme()` reason or the comment. Add the entry in the pull request that
  needs it, so a reviewer can see what the branch worked around and why.
